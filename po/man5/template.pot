#.  GABI ELF Reference for Note Sections:

#
#.  Note that it implies the sizes and alignments of notes depend on the ELF
#.  size (e.g. 32-bit ELFs have three 4-byte words and use 4-byte alignment
#.  while 64-bit ELFs use 8-byte words & alignment), but that is not the case
#.  in the real world.  Notes always have three 4-byte words as can be seen
#.  in the source links below (remember that Elf64_Word is a 32-bit quantity).
