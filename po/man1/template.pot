#.  .SH NOTES
#.  The standard version of
#.  .B ldd
#.  comes with glibc2.
#.  Libc5 came with an older version, still present
#.  on some systems.
#.  The long options are not supported by the libc5 version.
#.  On the other hand, the glibc2 version does not support
#.  .B \-V
#.  and only has the equivalent
#.  .BR \-\-version .
#.  .LP
#.  The libc5 version of this program will use the name of a library given
#.  on the command line as-is when it contains a \(aq/\(aq; otherwise it
#.  searches for the library in the standard locations.
#.  To run it
#.  on a shared library in the current directory, prefix the name with "./".
