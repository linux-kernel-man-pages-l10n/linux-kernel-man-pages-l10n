#.      renders a box sized group incapable of utilizing more that
#.      a single CPU total).  For example, if a group of NR_CPUS
#.      size competes with a singleton, load balancing will try to give
#.      the singleton a full CPU of its very own.  If groups intersect for

#.      net: Cap number of elements for sendmmsg
#.      To limit the amount of time we can spend in sendmmsg, cap the
#.      number of elements to UIO_MAXIOV (currently 1024).
#.      For error handling an application using sendmmsg needs to retry at
#.      the first unsent message, so capping is simpler and requires less
#.      application logic than returning EINVAL.

#.  When si_utime and si_stime where originally implemented, the

#.  A note from Andries Brouwer, July 2007
#.  > Is the story not rather more complicated for some calls like
#.  > stat(2)?
#.  Yes and no, mostly no. See /usr/include/sys/stat.h .
#.  The idea is here not so much that syscalls change, but that
#.  the definitions of struct stat and of the types dev_t and mode_t change.
#.  This means that libc (even if it does not call the kernel
#.  but only calls some internal function) must know what the
#.  format of dev_t or of struct stat is.
#.  The communication between the application and libc goes via
#.  the include file <sys/stat.h> that defines a _STAT_VER and
#.  _MKNOD_VER describing the layout of the data that user space
#.  uses. Each (almost each) occurrence of stat() is replaced by
#.  an occurrence of xstat() where the first parameter of xstat()
#.  is this version number _STAT_VER.
#.  Now, also the definitions used by the kernel change.
#.  But glibc copes with this in the standard way, and the
#.  struct stat as returned by the kernel is repacked into
#.  the struct stat as expected by the application.
#.  Thus, _STAT_VER and this setup cater for the application-libc
#.  interface, rather than the libc-kernel interface.
#.  (Note that the details depend on gcc being used as c compiler.)

#.  From an Aug 2015 conversation with Kees Cook where I asked why *all*

"B<pselect>()  is useful if you are waiting for a signal as well as for file "

#.  Linus: Now, imagine using the above in a media server, for example.
#.  Let's say that a year or two has passed, so that the video drivers
#.  have been updated to be able to do the splice thing, and what can
#.  you do? You can:
#.  - splice from the (mpeg or whatever - let's just assume that the video
#.    input is either digital or does the encoding on its own - like they
#.    pretty much all do) video input into a pipe (remember: no copies - the
#.    video input will just DMA directly into memory, and splice will just
#.    set up the pages in the pipe buffer)
#.  - tee that pipe to split it up
#.  - splice one end to a file (ie "save the compressed stream to disk")
#.  - splice the other end to a real-time video decoder window for your
#.    real-time viewing pleasure.
#.  Linus: Now, the advantage of splice()/tee() is that you can
#.  do zero-copy movement of data, and unlike sendfile() you can
#.  do it on _arbitrary_ data (and, as shown by "tee()", it's more
#.  than just sending the data to somebody else: you can duplicate
#.  the data and choose to forward it to two or more different
#.  users - for things like logging etc.).
