#.  One such race involves signals and ERESTARTSYS. If a file descriptor
#.  in use by a system call is closed and then reused by e.g. an

#.  call has restarted after ERESTARTSYS, the original system call will
#.  later restart with the reused file descriptor. This is most likely a

"GNU C library versions 2.3.4 up to and including 2.24 contained a wrapper "
