"X25 sockets provide an interface to the X.25 packet layer protocol.  This "
"allows applications to communicate over a public X.25 data network as "
"standardized by International Telecommunication Union's recommendation X.25 "
"(X.25 DTE-DCE mode).  X25 sockets can also be used for communication without"
" an intermediate X.25 network (X.25 DTE-DTE mode) as described in ISO-8208."
