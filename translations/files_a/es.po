#.  .SS Unsafe features
#.  Functions that are unsafe to call in certain contexts are annotated with

#.  AS-Unsafe features in this section indicate the functions are never safe
#.  to call when asynchronous signals are enabled.
#.  AC-Unsafe features
#.  indicate they are never safe to call when asynchronous cancellation is
#.  .\" enabled.
#.  There are no MT-Unsafe marks in this section.
#.  .TP
#.  .\" .I code
#.  Functions marked with
#.  .I lock
#.  as an AS-Unsafe feature may be
#.  .\" interrupted by a signal while holding a non-recursive lock.
#.  If the signal handler calls another such function that takes the same
#. lock,
#.  the result is a deadlock.
#.  Functions annotated with
#.  .I lock
#.  as an AC-Unsafe feature may, if canceled asynchronously,
#.  fail to release a lock that would have been released if their execution
#.  had not been interrupted by asynchronous thread cancellation.
#.  Once a lock is left taken,
#.  attempts to take that lock will block indefinitely.
#.  .TP
#.  .I corrupt
#.  Functions marked with
#.  .\" .I corrupt
#.  as an AS-Unsafe feature may corrupt
#.  data structures and misbehave when they interrupt,
#.  or are interrupted by, another such function.
#.  Unlike functions marked with
#.  .IR lock ,
#.  these take recursive locks to avoid MT-Safety problems,
#.  but this is not enough to stop a signal handler from observing
#.  a partially-updated data structure.
#.  Further corruption may arise from the interrupted function's
#.  failure to notice updates made by signal handlers.
#.  Functions marked with
#.  .I corrupt
#.  as an AC-Unsafe feature may leave
#.  data structures in a corrupt, partially updated state.
#.  Subsequent uses of the data structure may misbehave.
#.  .\" A special case, probably not worth documenting separately, involves
#.  .\" reallocing, or even freeing pointers.  Any case involving free could
#.  .\" be easily turned into an ac-safe leak by resetting the pointer before
#.  .\" releasing it; I don't think we have any case that calls for this sort
#.  .\" of fixing.  Fixing the realloc cases would require a new interface:
#.  .\" instead of @code{ptr=realloc(ptr,size)} we'd have to introduce
#.  .\" @code{acsafe_realloc(&ptr,size)} that would modify ptr before
#.  .\" releasing the old memory.  The ac-unsafe realloc could be implemented
#.  .\" in terms of an internal interface with this semantics (say
#.  .\" __acsafe_realloc), but since realloc can be overridden, the function
#.  .\" we call to implement realloc should not be this internal interface,
#.  .\" but another internal interface that calls __acsafe_realloc if realloc
#.  .\" was not overridden, and calls the overridden realloc with async
#.  .\" cancel disabled.  --lxoliva
#.  .TP
#.  .I heap
#.  Functions marked with
#.  .I heap
#.  may call heap memory management functions from the
#.  .BR malloc (3)/ free (3)
#.  family of functions and are only as safe as those functions.
#.  This note is thus equivalent to:
#.      | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock fd mem |
#.  .\" @sampsafety{@asunsafe{@asulock{}}@acunsafe{@aculock{} @acsfd{}
#. @acsmem{}}}
#.  .\"
#.  .\" Check for cases that should have used plugin instead of or in
#.  .\" addition to this.  Then, after rechecking gettext, adjust i18n if
#.  .\" needed.
#.  .TP
#.  .I dlopen
#.  Functions marked with
#.  .I dlopen
#.  use the dynamic loader to load
#.  shared libraries into the current execution image.
#.  This involves opening files, mapping them into memory,
#.  allocating additional memory, resolving symbols,
#.  applying relocations and more,
#.  all of this while holding internal dynamic loader locks.
#.  The locks are enough for these functions to be AS-Unsafe and AC-Unsafe,
#.  but other issues may arise.
#.  At present this is a placeholder for all
#.  potential safety issues raised by
#.  .BR dlopen (3).
#.  .\" dlopen runs init and fini sections of the module; does this mean
#.  .\" dlopen always implies plugin?
#.  .TP
#.  .I plugin
#.  Functions annotated with
#.  .I plugin
#.  may run code from plugins that
#.  may be external to the GNU C Library.
#.  Such plugin functions are assumed to be
#.  MT-Safe, AS-Unsafe and AC-Unsafe.
#.  Examples of such plugins are stack unwinding libraries,
#.  name service switch (NSS) and character set conversion (iconv) back-ends.
#.  Although the plugins mentioned as examples are all brought in by means
#.  of dlopen, the
#.  .I plugin
#.  keyword does not imply any direct
#.  involvement of the dynamic loader or the
#.  .I libdl
#.  interfaces,
#.  those are covered by
#.  .IR dlopen .
#.  For example, if one function loads a module and finds the addresses
#.  of some of its functions,
#.  while another just calls those already-resolved functions,
#.  the former will be marked with
#.  .IR dlopen ,
#.  whereas the latter will get the
#.  .IR plugin .
#.  When a single function takes all of these actions, then it gets both
#. marks.
#.  .TP
#.  .I i18n
#.  Functions marked with
#.  .I i18n
#.  may call internationalization
#.  functions of the
#.  .BR gettext (3)
#.  family and will be only as safe as those
#.  functions.
#.  This note is thus equivalent to:
#.      | MT-Safe env | AS-Unsafe corrupt heap dlopen | AC-Unsafe corrupt |
#.  .\" @sampsafety{@mtsafe{@mtsenv{}}@asunsafe{@asucorrupt{} @ascuheap{}
#. @ascudlopen{}}@acunsafe{@acucorrupt{}}}
#.  .TP
#.  .I timer
#.  Functions marked with
#.  .I timer
#.  use the
#.  .BR alarm (3)
#.  function or
#.  similar to set a time-out for a system call or a long-running operation.
#.  In a multi-threaded program, there is a risk that the time-out signal
#.  will be delivered to a different thread,
#.  thus failing to interrupt the intended thread.
#.  Besides being MT-Unsafe, such functions are always
#.  AS-Unsafe, because calling them in signal handlers may interfere with
#.  timers set in the interrupted code, and AC-Unsafe,
#.  because there is no safe way to guarantee an earlier timer
#.  will be reset in case of asynchronous cancellation.

#.  We consider access to objects passed as (indirect) arguments to
#.  functions to be data race free.
#.  The assurance of data race free objects
#.  is the caller's responsibility.
#.  We will not mark a function as MT-Unsafe or AS-Unsafe
#.  if it misbehaves when users fail to take the measures required by
#.  POSIX to avoid data races when dealing with such objects.
#.  As a general rule, if a function is documented as reading from
#.  an object passed (by reference) to it, or modifying it,
#.  users ought to use memory synchronization primitives
#.  to avoid data races just as they would should they perform
#.  the accesses themselves rather than by calling the library function.
#.  Standard I/O
#.  .RI ( "FILE *" )
#.  streams are the exception to the general rule,
#.  in that POSIX mandates the library to guard against data races
#.  in many functions that manipulate objects of this specific opaque type.
#.  We regard this as a convenience provided to users,
#.  rather than as a general requirement whose expectations
#.  should extend to other types.
#.  In order to remind users that guarding certain arguments is their
#.  responsibility, we will annotate functions that take objects of certain
#.  types as arguments.
#.  We draw the line for objects passed by users as follows:
#.  objects whose types are exposed to users,
#.  and that users are expected to access directly,
#.  such as memory buffers, strings,
#.  and various user-visible structured types, do
#.  .I not
#.  give reason for functions to be annotated with
#.  .IR race .
#.  It would be noisy and redundant with the general requirement,
#.  and not many would be surprised by the library's lack of internal
#.  guards when accessing objects that can be accessed directly by users.
#.  As for objects that are opaque or opaque-like,
#.  in that they are to be manipulated only by passing them
#.  to library functions (e.g.,
#.  .IR FILE ,
#.  .IR DIR ,
#.  .IR obstack ,
#.  .IR iconv_t ),
#.  there might be additional expectations as to internal coordination
#.  of access by the library.
#.  We will annotate, with
#.  .I race
#.  followed by a colon and the argument name,
#.  functions that take such objects but that do not take
#.  care of synchronizing access to them by default.
#.  For example,
#.  .I FILE
#.  stream
#.  .I unlocked
#.  functions
#.  .RB ( unlocked_stdio (3))
#.  will be annotated,
#.  but those that perform implicit locking on
#.  .I FILE
#.  streams by default will not,
#.  even though the implicit locking may be disabled on a per-stream basis.
#.  In either case, we will not regard as MT-Unsafe functions that may
#.  access user-supplied objects in unsafe ways should users fail to ensure
#.  the accesses are well defined.
#.  The notion prevails that users are expected to safeguard against
#.  data races any user-supplied objects that the library accesses
#.  on their behalf.
#.  .\" The above describes @mtsrace; @mtasurace is described below.
#.  This user responsibility does not apply, however,
#.  to objects controlled by the library itself,
#.  such as internal objects and static buffers used
#.  to return values from certain calls.
#.  When the library doesn't guard them against concurrent uses,
#.  these cases are regarded as MT-Unsafe and AS-Unsafe (although the
#.  .I race
#.  mark under AS-Unsafe will be omitted
#.  as redundant with the one under MT-Unsafe).
#.  As in the case of user-exposed objects,
#.  the mark may be followed by a colon and an identifier.
#.  The identifier groups all functions that operate on a
#.  certain unguarded object; users may avoid the MT-Safety issues related
#.  with unguarded concurrent access to such internal objects by creating a
#.  non-recursive mutex related with the identifier,
#.  and always holding the mutex when calling any function marked
#.  as racy on that identifier,
#.  as they would have to should the identifier be
#.  an object under user control.
#.  The non-recursive mutex avoids the MT-Safety issue,
#.  but it trades one AS-Safety issue for another,
#.  so use in asynchronous signals remains undefined.
#.  When the identifier relates to a static buffer used to hold return values,
#.  the mutex must be held for as long as the buffer remains in use
#.  by the caller.
#.  Many functions that return pointers to static buffers offer reentrant
#.  variants that store return values in caller-supplied buffers instead.
#.  In some cases, such as
#.  .BR tmpname (3),
#.  the variant is chosen not by calling an alternate entry point,
#.  but by passing a non-NULL pointer to the buffer in which the
#.  returned values are to be stored.
#.  These variants are generally preferable in multi-threaded programs,
#.  although some of them are not MT-Safe because of other internal buffers,
#.  also documented with
#.  .I race
#.  notes.

#.  Asynchronous Serial Host protocol (?)
#.  Notes from Eugene Syromyatnikov:
#.  I haven't found any concrete information about this one;
#.  it never was implemented in Linux, at least, judging by historical
#.  repos.  There is also this file (and its variations):
#.  https://github.com/ecki/net-tools/blob/master/lib/ash.c
#.  ( https://github.com/ecki/net-tools/commits/master/lib/ash.c )
#.  it mentions "NET-2 distribution" (BSD Net/2?), but, again, I failed
#.  to find any mentions of "ash" protocol there.
#.  (for the reference:
#.  ftp://pdp11.org.ru/pub/unix-archive/Distributions/UCB/Net2/net2.tar.gz )
#.  Another source that mentions it is
#.  https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug101-uart-gateway-
#. protocol-reference.pdf
#.  https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug115-ashv3-protocol-
#. reference.pdf
#.  but I doubt that it's related, as former files use 64-byte addresses and
#.  "Hamming-encode of hops", and that's barely combines with a protocol
#.  that is mainly used over serial connection.
